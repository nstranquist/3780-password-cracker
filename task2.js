/**
 * In this task you are writing a program to generate random password files to attempt to crack. When run, this program should prompt for a particular password range (for example, all passwords between length 3 and 8) and a number of accounts (100 for example). It will then create usernames and passwords for 100 accounts in the specified ranges for each of the 3 password files. For this purpose it is probably useful for this program to create usernames of a particular format (usraaaaaaa-usraaaaadv) for example.

  // prompt for number of accounts (i.e. 100)




  // create usernames and passwords for 100 accounts in specified pw ranges for each of the 3 password files
